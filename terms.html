  </ul>

  <h2>4. Supplier Vetting & Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>We perform reasonable screening based on documentation and references provided. Screening is not a guarantee of performance, quality, or legal compliance. You remain responsible for independent verification.</p>

  <h2>5. Fees</h2>
  <p>Fees (if any) will be disclosed prior to engagement and may be buyer‑paid, supplier‑paid, or success‑fee based.</p>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access where we believe these Terms have been breached or to comply with law.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
